# Google OAuth Credentials Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for generating `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` for the Divemap application.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account
- Access to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. **Navigate to Google Cloud Console**
   - Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create a New Project**
   - Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page
   - Click "New Project"
   - Enter a project name: `divemap-oauth` (or your preferred name)
   - Click "Create"

3. **Select Your Project**
   - Make sure your new project is selected in the project dropdown

## Step 2: Enable Required APIs

**Note:** Google has reorganized their APIs. For OAuth authentication, you have a few options:

1. **Navigate to APIs & Services**
   - In the left sidebar, click "APIs & Services" > "Library"

2. **Option 1: Enable Identity Toolkit API (Recommended)**
   - Search for "Identity Toolkit API"
   - This is the current API for Google Identity services
   - Click on it and then click "Enable"

3. **Option 2: Enable People API (Alternative)**
   - Search for "People API" or "Google People API"
   - This provides access to user profile information
   - If found, enable it

4. **Option 3: Skip API enabling entirely**
   - The OAuth 2.0 credentials will work without explicitly enabling these APIs
   - Google's OAuth system is available by default
   - You can proceed directly to Step 3

**Recommendation:** Enable the **Identity Toolkit API** if you find it, as it's specifically designed for authentication flows.

## Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. **Access OAuth Consent Screen**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"

2. **Choose User Type**
   - Select "External" (unless you have a Google Workspace organization)
   - Click "Create"

3. **Fill in App Information**
   - **App name**: `Divemap`
   - **User support email**: Your email address
   - **App logo**: Optional - you can upload a logo later
   - **App domain**: Leave blank for now
   - **Developer contact information**: Your email address

4. **Add Scopes**
   - Look for a section called "Scopes" or "Scopes for Google APIs"
   - You may see a button like "Add or remove scopes" or "Edit scopes"
   - Click on it to open the scopes selection
   - In the scopes selection dialog, you'll see different categories:
     - Look for "Sensitive scopes" or "Basic scopes"
     - Find and check the following scopes:
       - `openid` (OpenID Connect)
       - `email` (See your email address)
       - `profile` (See your name, profile picture, and other public info)
   - If you can't find these specific scopes, look for:
     - "Google Identity" scopes
     - "Basic profile information" scopes
     - "Email address" scopes
   - Click "Update" or "Save" to confirm your selection

5. **Add Test Users (for External apps)**
   - Click "Add users"
   - Add your email address and any other test users
   - **IMPORTANT**: Only the email addresses you add here can use the OAuth app while it's in testing
   - Click "Add"

6. **Save and Continue**
   - Click "Save and continue" through all sections
   - You can skip optional sections for now

## Step 4: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. **Navigate to Credentials**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" (or "Clients" in some interfaces)
   - If you don't see "Credentials", look for "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" directly

2. **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
   - Look for "Create Credentials" or "Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
   - Click on it to start the creation process

3. **Configure Application Type**
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Click "Create"

4. **Set Application Details**
   - **Name**: `Divemap Web Client`
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
     ```
     http://localhost
     http://localhost:8000
     https://your-production-domain.com (when ready for production)
     ```
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**:
     ```
     http://localhost
     http://localhost/
     https://your-production-domain.com (when ready for production)
     ```

5. **Create the Credentials**
   - Click "Create"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy both the Client ID and Client Secret immediately
   - You won't be able to see the Client Secret again after leaving this page

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

### Backend Configuration

1. **Copy Environment Template**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add Google OAuth Credentials**
   Edit your `.env` file and add:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
   ```

### Frontend Configuration

1. **Copy Frontend Environment Template**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add Google Client ID**
   Edit your `frontend/.env` file and add:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
   ```

## Step 6: Verify Database Schema

Ensure your database has the `google_id` field in the users table. If you haven't run migrations yet:

```bash
cd backend
source divemap_venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="/home/kargig/src/divemap/backend/divemap_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
python run_migrations.py
```

## Step 7: Test the Configuration

1. **Start the Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source divemap_venv/bin/activate
   export PYTHONPATH="/home/kargig/src/divemap/backend/divemap_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test Google OAuth**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost`
   - Go to the login or register page
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Complete the OAuth flow

## Step 8: Handle Testing Mode Issues

**If you get "Access blocked: Authorization Error":**

1. **Check Test Users**
   - Go back to Google Cloud Console
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Scroll down to "Test users" section
   - Make sure your email address is listed there

2. **Add Your Email as Test User**
   - Click "Add users"
   - Add the exact email address you're using to test
   - Click "Save"

3. **Verify Email Address**
   - Make sure you're using the same email address that's listed as a test user
   - The email must match exactly (including case sensitivity)

4. **Alternative Solutions**
   - **Option A**: Use a different Google account that's added as a test user
   - **Option B**: Publish your app to production (not recommended for development)
   - **Option C**: Wait a few minutes after adding test users (changes can take time to propagate)

## Step 9: Fix 403 Error on Google Identity Services Button

**If you get a 403 error when the Google button tries to load:**

1. **Check Frontend Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cat .env
   ```
   - Verify `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set correctly
   - Make sure it matches your Google Cloud Console Client ID exactly

2. **Verify Google Cloud Console Configuration**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console > "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Check that `http://localhost` is in "Authorized JavaScript origins"
   - Check that `http://127.0.0.1` is also added (if you're using 127.0.0.1)

3. **Add Missing Origins**
   - In Google Cloud Console, edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Add these to "Authorized JavaScript origins":
     ```
     http://localhost
     http://127.0.0.1
     https://localhost
     https://127.0.0.1
     ```

4. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try in an incognito/private window
   - Restart your browser

5. **Restart Development Servers**
   ```bash
   # Stop both frontend and backend servers
   # Then restart them
   cd frontend && npm start
   cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Invalid Client ID" Error**
   - Verify the Client ID is exactly the same in both frontend and backend
   - Check that you're using the correct project in Google Cloud Console
   - Ensure the domain is authorized in the OAuth consent screen

2. **"Can't find scopes" Error**
   - The scopes section might be in a different location
   - Look for "Scopes for Google APIs" or "OAuth scopes"
   - Try scrolling down on the OAuth consent screen page
   - The scopes might be automatically included for basic OAuth apps
   - If you can't find scopes, the basic ones (`openid`, `email`, `profile`) are often included by default

3. **"Can't find Credentials section" Error**
   - Google has reorganized the interface
   - Look for "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" directly in the sidebar
   - Or search for "Credentials" in the search bar
   - The interface might show "Clients" instead of "Credentials"
   - Try going to "APIs & Services" and look for any credential-related options

2. **"Redirect URI Mismatch" Error**
   - Verify the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches your application URL
   - For development, ensure `http://localhost` is in the authorized origins
   - Check that there are no trailing slashes causing mismatches

3. **"Google Identity Services Not Loaded" Error**
   - Check that `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set in your frontend `.env` file
   - Verify the Google Identity script is loading in the browser
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Note: The service is now called "Google Identity" rather than "Google Identity Services"

4. **"Token Verification Failed" Error**
   - Ensure `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set in backend `.env`
   - Verify the Client ID matches between frontend and backend
   - Check that the Google Cloud project is active

5. **"Access blocked: Authorization Error" Error**
   - This happens when your app is in "Testing" mode
   - **Solution 1**: Add your email to test users in OAuth consent screen
   - **Solution 2**: Publish your app to production (not recommended for development)
   - **Solution 3**: Use a different Google account that's added as a test user
   - Check that you're using the same email address that's listed as a test user

6. **"403 Error on Google Identity Services Button" Error**
   - This happens when the Google button fails to load
   - **Solution 1**: Check that `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set correctly in frontend `.env`
   - **Solution 2**: Verify the Client ID matches exactly between frontend and backend
   - **Solution 3**: Check that the domain is authorized in Google Cloud Console
   - **Solution 4**: Clear browser cache and cookies
   - **Solution 5**: Try in an incognito/private browser window

5. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure the `google_id` column exists in the users table
   - Run migrations if needed: `python run_migrations.py`

### Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use different credentials for development and production
   - Regularly rotate your Client Secrets

2. **Google Cloud Console**
   - Monitor OAuth usage in the Google Cloud Console
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
   - Regularly review authorized domains and redirect URIs

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Update authorized origins and redirect URIs for production domains
   - Use HTTPS for all production URLs
   - Set up proper CORS configuration

## Production Setup

When deploying to production:

1. **Update Google Cloud Console**
   - Add your production domain to authorized origins
   - Add production redirect URIs
   - Remove development URLs if not needed

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Set production environment variables
   - Use production Google OAuth credentials

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Enable HTTPS for all production URLs
   - Set up proper CORS headers
   - Monitor OAuth usage and errors
