# Refresh Token Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing refresh tokens, background token renewal, and silent renewal in the Divemap application. The goal is to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining security through short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED - All Phases

**Backend Infrastructure** ✅
- Database schema for refresh tokens and audit logs
- Token service with creation, validation, and rotation
- Authentication endpoints for login, refresh, and logout
- Security features (token rotation, audit logging, session limits)

**Frontend Implementation** ✅
- Authentication context with token management
- API interceptors for automatic token renewal
- Session management and user state handling
- Integration with Google OAuth

**Security & Testing** ✅
- Comprehensive test suite for all token operations
- Security validation and edge case handling
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for security monitoring

**Nginx Proxy Integration** ✅
- Development environment proxy setup
- Cross-origin cookie resolution
- Unified origin for frontend and backend

## When Tokens Are Renewed/Refreshed

### **Access Token Expiration** (Every 15 minutes)
- Access tokens have a 15-minute lifetime for security
- When expired, any API request returns 401 Unauthorized
- Frontend automatically detects 401 and triggers refresh

### **Automatic Refresh on 401 Errors**
- Frontend API interceptor automatically detects 401 responses
- Triggers token refresh using the refresh token from cookies
- Retries the original failed request with the new access token
- **No proactive scheduling** - tokens only refresh when needed

### **User Authentication Events**
- **Login/Registration**: New access token issued immediately
- **Token Refresh**: New access token + rotated refresh token
- **Logout**: Current refresh token revoked on backend

### **Token Refresh Process**
1. **Frontend detects 401** → calls `/api/v1/auth/refresh`
2. **Backend validates refresh token** → generates new access token
3. **Token rotation occurs** → new refresh token issued, old one revoked
4. **Frontend receives new access token** → stores in localStorage
5. **Original failed request retries** → with new access token

### **Security Features**
- **Token rotation**: Each refresh generates a new refresh token
- **Automatic revocation**: Old refresh tokens become invalid immediately
- **HTTP-only cookies**: Refresh tokens protected from XSS attacks
- **Short-lived access tokens**: Minimize exposure window if compromised
- **Request queuing**: Prevents multiple simultaneous refresh attempts

## Architecture

### **Token Flow**
```
User Login → Access Token (15min) + Refresh Token (30 days)
     ↓
API Requests → Check Access Token
     ↓
Token Expired? → 401 Response
     ↓
Frontend Interceptor → /api/v1/auth/refresh
     ↓
New Access Token + Rotated Refresh Token
     ↓
Retry Original Request → Success
```

### **Security Model**
- **Access Token**: Short-lived (15 min), sent with every request
- **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (30 days), HTTP-only cookie, rotated on each use
- **Token Rotation**: Prevents refresh token reuse and enhances security
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks all authentication events for monitoring

## Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=15          # Short-lived for security
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=30           # Longer-lived for convenience
ENABLE_TOKEN_ROTATION=true             # Issue new refresh token with each refresh
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true              # Log authentication events
MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS_PER_USER=5         # Limit concurrent sessions
```

### **Cookie Settings**
```bash
REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_SECURE=false      # Set to true in production (HTTPS)
REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=true     # Prevent XSS attacks
REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax      # Allow cross-origin cookies
```

## Testing

### **Test Coverage**
- ✅ Token creation and validation
- ✅ Token refresh and rotation
- ✅ Token revocation and cleanup
- ✅ Security features and edge cases
- ✅ Integration with authentication flow
- ✅ Error handling and rate limiting

### **Manual Testing**
- Login and token generation
- Automatic token refresh on expiration
- Token rotation verification
- Logout and token revocation
- Cross-origin cookie handling

## Benefits

### **User Experience**
- Seamless authentication without frequent logins
- Automatic token renewal in background
- No user intervention required for token management

### **Security**
- Short-lived access tokens minimize exposure
- Token rotation prevents refresh token reuse
- HTTP-only cookies protect against XSS
- Audit logging for security monitoring

### **Performance**
- Reduced authentication overhead
- Efficient token management
- No unnecessary token refresh requests

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- [ ] Token blacklisting for compromised tokens
- [ ] Enhanced audit logging and monitoring
- [ ] Token usage analytics and reporting
- [ ] Advanced session management features

### **Security Improvements**
- [ ] Rate limiting for refresh endpoints
- [ ] Geographic token restrictions
- [ ] Device fingerprinting for token validation
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication integration

## Conclusion

The refresh token system has been successfully implemented with comprehensive security features, automatic token renewal, and seamless user experience. The system automatically handles token expiration and renewal without user intervention, while maintaining high security standards through token rotation, audit logging, and proper cookie management.

The integration with Nginx proxy resolves cross-origin cookie issues and provides a production-ready architecture for both development and production environments.
