# Cold Start Optimization Plan

**Last Updated**: October 8, 2025  
**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Version**: 1.0 - Comprehensive cold start optimization

## Current Performance Analysis

### Fresh Timeline Analysis (2025-10-08T17:43:XXZ)

Based on comprehensive log analysis from fresh cold start:

- **Nginx**: ~1s (✅ Fast)
- **Database**: ~5s total
  - Container startup: ~1s
  - InnoDB initialization: ~1s (unavoidable)
  - MySQL ready for connections: ~3s
- **Backend**: ~10s total
  - Database port check: ~0s (immediate)
  - Database query readiness wait: ~5s (🚨 **MAJOR BOTTLENECK**)
  - Migration execution: ~1s (🚨 **OPTIMIZABLE**)
  - FastAPI startup: ~3s (🚨 **MAJOR BOTTLENECK**)
- **Frontend**: Not applicable (served by Nginx)

### Critical Issues (Updated)

1. **Database Query Readiness Wait**: 5 seconds (biggest bottleneck)
2. **FastAPI Startup**: 3 seconds (second biggest)
3. **Migration Execution**: 1 second (optimizable)
4. **InnoDB Initialization**: 1 second (unavoidable)

### Key Insights

- **Double database check is necessary**: Port check vs query readiness check
- **Total cold start**: ~10 seconds (consistent across tests)
- **Health check failures**: ~1 second (much better than initially estimated)
- **No redundant waiting**: Each wait serves a specific purpose
- **Recent findings**: Database optimizations (2.1, 2.2) provided incidental improvements to FastAPI startup and migration execution
- **Critical discovery**: `lru_cache` won't help cold start optimization (cache empty on every restart)

### Homepage Impact on Router Lazy Loading

**Critical Discovery**: The homepage immediately calls `/api/v1/stats` on load, which means:

1. **Router Lazy Loading Won't Help Homepage**: The stats endpoint is in `main.py`, not in a router
2. **All Routers Loaded Unnecessarily**: Current implementation loads all routers during startup
3. **Heavy Imports Upfront**: All router modules imported immediately, including heavy dependencies

**Current Flow**:

```text
User visits homepage → Frontend calls /api/v1/stats → Backend must be fully started → Stats endpoint queries database
```

**Optimized Flow**:

```text
User visits homepage → Frontend calls /api/v1/stats → Backend responds with cached/lightweight stats → Routers load lazily on demand
```

**Impact on Optimization Strategy**:

- **True lazy loading** will only help for non-homepage routes
- **Homepage optimization** requires stats endpoint optimization, not router lazy loading
- **Most users hit homepage first**, so router lazy loading has limited impact on initial cold start

- ✅ **Container startup parallelized** (major architectural improvement)

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Wins (1-2 hours)

#### 1.1 Skip Migrations in Production
**Problem**: Migrations run on every cold start, taking 1 second
**Solution**: Run migrations only during deployment, not on startup

```bash
# Modify startup.sh to skip migrations in production
if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" = "production" ]; then
    echo "🚀 Production mode - skipping migrations"
    echo "✅ Migrations should be run during deployment"
else
    echo "🚀 Development mode - running migrations..."
    python run_migrations.py
fi
```

**Expected Impact**: -1 second (10% improvement)

#### 1.2 Optimize FastAPI Startup
**Problem**: FastAPI startup takes 3 seconds (router loading + initialization)
**Solution**: Implement true lazy loading for routers

**Current Issue**: All routers loaded synchronously during startup (line 258: `load_routers()`)
**Homepage Impact**: Homepage calls `/api/v1/stats` immediately, but this endpoint is in main.py, not a router

```python
# In main.py - implement true lazy loading
def load_routers_lazy():
    """Load routers only when first API call is made"""
    if not hasattr(app, '_routers_loaded'):
        print("🔧 Loading API routers lazily...")
        router_start = time.time()
        
        # Import routers only when needed
        from app.routers import auth, dive_sites, users, diving_centers, tags, diving_organizations, user_certifications, newsletters, system, privacy
        from app.routers.dives import router as dives_router
        
        # Include routers
        app.include_router(auth.router, prefix="/api/v1/auth", tags=["Authentication"])
        app.include_router(users.router, prefix="/api/v1/users", tags=["Users"])
        # ... other routers
        
        app._routers_loaded = True
        router_time = time.time() - router_start
        print(f"✅ Routers loaded lazily in {router_time:.2f}s")

# Remove the immediate load_routers() call
# load_routers()  # Remove this line

# Add middleware to load routers on first API call
@app.middleware("http")
async def lazy_router_loading(request: Request, call_next):
    if request.url.path.startswith("/api/") and not hasattr(app, '_routers_loaded'):
        load_routers_lazy()
    return await call_next(request)
```

**Expected Impact**: -2 seconds (20% improvement)

#### 1.3 Improve Health Check
**Problem**: Health check fails for ~1 second during startup
**Solution**: Create lightweight health endpoint

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "ok", "timestamp": time.time()}

@app.get("/health/ready")
async def readiness_check():
    # Check database connection
    try:
        # Quick DB ping
        return {"status": "ready"}
    except:
        return {"status": "not ready"}, 503
```

**Expected Impact**: -1 second of 502 errors

#### 1.4 Optimize Homepage API Call
**Problem**: Homepage immediately calls `/api/v1/stats` which triggers full backend startup
**Solution**: Create lightweight stats endpoint for immediate response

**Current Flow**:
1. User visits homepage
2. Frontend immediately calls `/api/v1/stats`
3. Backend must be fully started to respond
4. Stats endpoint performs 4 database queries

**Why `lru_cache` Won't Help**:
- **Cache is empty on every cold start** - no optimization benefit
- **Homepage users hit first request** - no cache hit
- **Cold start time unchanged** - database queries still required

**Real Optimization Strategy**:
```python
# Option 1: Lightweight stats endpoint (immediate response)
@app.get("/api/v1/stats")
async def get_statistics():
    """Lightweight stats without database queries for cold start"""
    return {
        "dives": 0,  # Show placeholder immediately
        "dive_sites": 0,
        "reviews": 0,
        "diving_centers": 0
    }

# Option 2: Background stats loading
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    """Load real stats in background after FastAPI starts"""
    asyncio.create_task(load_stats_background())

async def load_stats_background():
    """Load real stats in background and update cache"""
    # Load real stats asynchronously
    # Update in-memory cache when ready
    pass

# Option 3: Pre-computed stats (database level)
# Store stats in database table, updated periodically
# No real-time calculation needed
@app.get("/api/v1/stats")
async def get_statistics():
    """Simple SELECT from pre-computed stats table"""
    # No complex queries, no calculation
    pass
```

**Expected Impact**: -2-3 seconds (20-30% improvement)

### Phase 2: Database Optimizations (2-3 hours)

#### 2.1 Optimize Database Readiness Check ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
**Problem**: Database query readiness check takes 5 seconds
**Solution**: Implement fixed interval retry strategy for faster cold start detection

**Why Fixed Intervals vs Exponential Backoff**:
- **Cold starts are predictable**: Database startup time is consistent (~4-5 seconds)
- **Fixed intervals detect readiness faster**: 0.2s intervals catch database as soon as it's ready
- **Exponential backoff is slower**: 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.8s, 1.6s, 3.2s... takes longer to detect

**Actual Implementation**:
```python
# In run_migrations.py - fixed interval retry strategy
def wait_for_database(max_retries=25, fixed_delay=0.2):
    """Wait for database to be available with fixed intervals (optimized for cold starts)"""
    print("Waiting for database to be available...")
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            with engine.connect() as conn:
                conn.execute(sa.text("SELECT 1"))
            print("✅ Database is available!")
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"⏳ Database not ready (attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}): {e}")
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                # Fixed interval: 0.2s between attempts (optimized for cold starts)
                print(f"⏳ Waiting {fixed_delay}s before next attempt...")
                time.sleep(fixed_delay)
    
    print("❌ Database is not available after maximum retries")
    return False
```

```bash
# In startup.sh - fixed interval retry strategy
attempt=1
max_attempts=25
fixed_delay=0.2

while [ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]; do
    echo "Attempt $attempt/$max_attempts: Checking database connectivity..."
    
    if check_db; then
        echo "✅ Database is ready!"
        break
    else
        echo "❌ Database not ready yet. Attempt $attempt/$max_attempts failed."
        
        if [ $attempt -eq $max_attempts ]; then
            echo "💥 ERROR: Database connection failed after $max_attempts attempts. Exiting."
            exit 1
        fi
        
        # Fixed interval: 0.2s between attempts (optimized for cold starts)
        echo "⏳ Waiting ${fixed_delay}s before next attempt..."
        sleep $fixed_delay
        
        attempt=$((attempt + 1))
    fi
done
```

**Timing Comparison**:
- **Before (exponential)**: 0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s = ~15.5s total
- **After (fixed)**: 0.2s × 25 attempts = 5s total (matches database startup time)
- **Improvement**: 10.5s faster (68% improvement in retry efficiency)

**Expected Impact**: -2.9 seconds (19% improvement) - **Note**: Actual impact limited by database startup time (~5s)

**Recent Fix (2025-10-08)**: Added `connect_timeout=2` to reduce connection timeout from 5s to 2s for faster cold start detection.

#### 2.2 Database Connection Pooling ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
**Problem**: New connections on every startup, no connection warming
**Solution**: Optimize connection pool settings and pre-warm connections

#### 2.3 Nginx Pre-warming ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
**Problem**: Database and backend containers only start when first API call is made
**Solution**: Nginx startup script sends non-blocking pings to trigger container startup

**Actual Implementation**:
```bash
# Embedded in nginx/Dockerfile.prod as startup-wrapper.sh
echo '#!/bin/sh' > /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'echo "🚀 Starting Nginx with pre-warming..."' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'echo "📡 Pre-warming database at ${DB_HOST:-divemap-db.flycast}:${DB_PORT:-3306}..."' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'echo "📡 Pre-warming backend at ${BACKEND_HOST:-divemap-backend.flycast}:${BACKEND_PORT:-80}..."' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'timeout 1s nc -6 -w 1 "${DB_HOST:-divemap-db.flycast}" "${DB_PORT:-3306}" < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1 &' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'echo "✅ Database ping sent (non-blocking)"' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'timeout 1s curl -s -f "http://${BACKEND_HOST:-divemap-backend.flycast}:${BACKEND_PORT:-80}/" > /dev/null 2>&1 &' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'echo "✅ Backend ping sent (non-blocking)"' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'echo "🎯 Pre-warming complete! Starting Nginx..."' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh && \
echo 'exec nginx -g "daemon off;"' >> /usr/local/bin/startup-wrapper.sh
```

**Key Features**:
- **Database ping**: Uses `netcat` for TCP-level ping (appropriate for database)
- **Backend ping**: Uses `curl` for HTTP-level ping (appropriate for web service)
- **Non-blocking**: Both pings run in background with `&`
- **Timeout protection**: 1-second timeout prevents hanging
- **IPv6 support**: Uses `-6` flag for IPv6 compatibility
- **Environment variables**: Configurable via `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `BACKEND_HOST`, `BACKEND_PORT`

**Actual Results**:
- **Nginx startup**: ~1s (unchanged)
- **Database startup**: 5s → 3s (40% faster due to parallel startup)
- **Backend startup**: Immediate database connection (no 5s wait)
- **Total cold start**: 10s → 6s (40% improvement)
- **Container startup**: Sequential → Parallel (major architectural improvement)

**Expected Impact**: -3-5 seconds (parallel container startup) ✅ **ACHIEVED**

**Actual Implementation**:
```python
# In database.py - optimized connection pool settings
engine = create_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    pool_pre_ping=True,  # Validate connections before use
    pool_recycle=3600,   # Recycle connections every hour
    pool_size=10,        # Increased pool size for better performance
    max_overflow=20,     # Increased overflow for peak usage
    pool_timeout=30,     # Connection acquisition timeout
    pool_reset_on_return='commit',  # Reset connections on return

)

def warm_database_connections():
    """Pre-warm database connections for faster startup"""
    try:
        print("🔧 Warming database connections...")
        warm_start = time.time()
        
        # Import sqlalchemy for proper text execution
        from sqlalchemy import text
        
        # Create a few connections to warm up the pool
        connections = []
        for i in range(min(3, engine.pool.size())):
            try:
                conn = engine.connect()
                # Test the connection with a simple query using proper SQLAlchemy text
                conn.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
                connections.append(conn)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"⚠️ Failed to warm connection {i+1}: {e}")
        
        # Close the warmed connections

        return True

        print(f"⚠️ Failed to warm database connections: {e}")
        return False
```

```python
# In main.py - integrate database warming into FastAPI startup
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    """Log startup completion with timing and warm database connections"""
    print(f"🎯 FastAPI application fully started in {total_startup_time:.2f}s")
    print(f"🔧 Environment: {os.getenv('ENVIRONMENT', 'production')}")
    print(f"🔧 Log level: {log_level}")
    print(f"🔧 Database URL configured: {'Yes' if os.getenv('DATABASE_URL') else 'No'}")
    
    # Warm database connections for better performance
    from app.database import warm_database_connections
    warm_database_connections()
```

**Key Improvements**:
- **Increased pool size**: 10 connections (from default 5)
- **Increased overflow**: 20 connections (from default 10)
- **Extended recycle time**: 3600s (1 hour, from default 1800s)
- **Added connection reset**: `pool_reset_on_return='commit'`
- **Pre-warm connections**: Test connections during startup
- **Fixed SQLAlchemy text execution**: Proper `text("SELECT 1")` usage

**Actual Results**:
- **Database warming**: 0.05s (was failing before)
- **Connection pool**: Ready for immediate use
- **Incidental benefits**: FastAPI startup improved by 36% (3s → 1.91s)

**Expected Impact**: -0.5 seconds (5% improvement) - **Note**: Provided incidental FastAPI startup improvement

#### 2.3 Database Migration Strategy
**Problem**: Migrations run on every cold start
**Solution**: Run migrations during deployment

```bash
# Add to fly.toml
[deploy]
  release_command = "python run_migrations.py"

# Modify startup.sh
if [ "$SKIP_MIGRATIONS" = "true" ]; then
    echo "🚀 Skipping migrations (already run during deployment)"
else
    python run_migrations.py
fi
```

**Expected Impact**: -1 second (10% improvement)

### Phase 3: Application Optimizations (3-4 hours)

#### 3.1 Lazy Import Strategy
**Problem**: Heavy imports on startup
**Solution**: Import only when needed

```python
# Lazy import pattern
def get_dive_sites_service():
    from app.services.dive_sites_service import DiveSitesService
    return DiveSitesService()

# Use in routes
@app.get("/api/v1/dive-sites/")
async def get_dive_sites():
    service = get_dive_sites_service()
    return await service.get_dive_sites()
```

#### 3.2 Optimize Dependencies ❌ **REVERTED**
**Problem**: Heavy dependencies loaded on startup
**Solution**: Load dependencies lazily with caching

**Actual Implementation**:
```python
# Created app/lazy_imports.py - centralized lazy loading system
def get_heavy_dependency(dependency_name: str) -> Any:
    """Lazy load heavy dependencies only when needed with caching"""
    if dependency_name in _loaded_dependencies:
        return _loaded_dependencies[dependency_name]
    
    try:
        if dependency_name == "openai":
            import openai
            _loaded_dependencies[dependency_name] = openai
            return openai
        elif dependency_name == "requests":
            import requests
            _loaded_dependencies[dependency_name] = requests
            return requests
        # ... other dependencies
    except ImportError as e:
        logger.error(f"❌ Failed to lazy load {dependency_name}: {e}")
        raise ImportError(f"Could not import {dependency_name}: {e}")

# Convenience functions for common dependencies
def get_openai(): return get_heavy_dependency("openai")
def get_requests(): return get_heavy_dependency("requests")
def get_httpx(): return get_heavy_dependency("httpx")
def get_google_auth(): return get_heavy_dependency("google_auth")
def get_quopri(): return get_heavy_dependency("quopri")
def get_difflib(): return get_heavy_dependency("difflib")
```

**Files Updated**:
- **Created**: `app/lazy_imports.py` - Centralized lazy loading system
- **Updated**: `app/routers/newsletters.py` - Lazy load openai, requests, quopri, difflib, email_parser
- **Updated**: `app/routers/dive_sites.py` - Lazy load difflib
- **Updated**: `app/routers/diving_centers.py` - Lazy load difflib, requests
- **Updated**: `app/turnstile_service.py` - Lazy load httpx
- **Updated**: `app/google_auth.py` - Lazy load google auth libraries
- **Updated**: `app/utils.py` - Lazy load difflib

**Key Features**:
- **Caching**: Dependencies loaded once and cached for subsequent use
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of import failures
- **Logging**: Debug logging for dependency loading
- **Type safety**: Proper type hints and return types
- **Convenience functions**: Easy-to-use functions for common dependencies

**Expected Impact**: -0.5 seconds (5% improvement) - **Note**: Reduces startup time by avoiding heavy imports during FastAPI initialization

**Status**: ❌ **REVERTED** - Caused test failures in geographic search functionality. The lazy loading implementation introduced complexity that broke existing functionality. Database optimizations (sections 2.1 and 2.2) were preserved as they work correctly.

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Optimizations (4-6 hours)

#### 4.1 Pre-warm Containers
**Problem**: Cold containers take time to start
**Solution**: Keep at least one container warm

```yaml
# In fly.toml
[processes]
  app = "startup.sh"
  warmup = "python warmup.py"

# Keep one container always running
[env]
  KEEP_ALIVE = "true"
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations (6-8 hours)

#### 4.2 Container Image Optimization
**Problem**: Large container images take time to start
**Solution**: Optimize Docker images

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# Build stage

FROM python:3.11-slim as runtime
# Runtime stage with minimal dependencies
```

#### 4.3 Application Caching
**Problem**: No caching on startup
**Solution**: Implement startup caching

```python
# Cache frequently used data
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_cache():
    # Pre-load frequently used data
    cache.set("dive_sites", await get_dive_sites())
    cache.set("tags", await get_tags())
```
