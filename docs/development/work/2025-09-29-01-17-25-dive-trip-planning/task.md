# Implement dive trip planning system

**Status:** Refining
**Created:** 2025-09-29-01-17-25
**Agent PID:** 661645
**Branch:** feature/dive-trip-planning

## Description

A comprehensive dive trip planning platform that allows groups of divers to collaboratively plan their next dive trip together. The system goes beyond simple voting to provide a complete planning solution including group management, logistics integration, smart recommendations, and real-time collaboration.

**Core Features (GA Release):**

- **Multi-Preference Voting**: Users can rank their preferences (1st, 2nd, 3rd choice) with weighted voting
- **Group Management**: Set group size limits, skill level requirements, buddy pair matching, and emergency contacts
- **Logistics Integration**: Weather monitoring, transportation planning, diving center booking, equipment rental
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions based on group dynamics, weather, and past success
- **Trip Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common scenarios (Weekend Warrior, Liveaboard, Training Trip)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface for planning and participation

**Future Features (Post-GA):**

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Live updates, group messaging, and collaborative editing
- **Advanced Mobile Features**: Offline access, GPS integration, and on-the-go planning

**Core User Flows (GA Release):**

1. **Creator Flow**: Create plan → Select sites/times → Set group requirements → Configure logistics → Publish (public) or share URL (private)
2. **Participant Flow**: View plan → Rank preferences → See voting results
3. **Results Flow**: After deadline → System calculates optimal combination → Notify participants → Link to booking

**Future User Flows (Post-GA):**

4. **Enhanced Participant Flow**: View plan → Rank preferences → Participate in group chat → See real-time results
5. **Post-Trip Flow**: Rate experience → Update dive logs → Learn from trip outcomes
