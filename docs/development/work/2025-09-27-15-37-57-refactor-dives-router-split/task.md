**Status:** In Progress
**Created:** 2025-09-27T15:37:57Z
**Started:** 2025-09-27T15:45:00Z
**Agent PID:** 498724
**Branch:** feature/refactor-dives-router-split

## Original Todo

Split the oversized `backend/app/routers/dives.py` file (130KB, 3,400+ lines) into multiple focused modules to improve maintainability, editability, and team development workflow.

## Description

The `dives.py` router has grown to 130KB with 63 functions, making it difficult to navigate, edit, and maintain. The file contains multiple distinct functional areas that can be logically separated into focused modules. This refactoring will improve code organization, reduce cognitive load, and enable better parallel development.
