**Status:** In Progress
**Created:** 2025-09-29T01:53:27Z
**Started:** 2025-10-13T10:42:00Z
**Agent PID:** 661645
**Branch:** feature/dive-route-drawing-implementation

## Description

Implement a dive route drawing and selection system that allows users to draw their exact dive paths on dive site maps and share them with the community. The system will build upon the existing Leaflet mapping infrastructure and integrate seamlessly with the current dive logging and dive site management systems.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Segment Route Drawing**: Users can draw dive routes with multiple segments (walk, swim, scuba) directly on dive site maps using mouse and touch interactions in a full-screen interface
- **2D Route Data**: Routes are stored as 2D GeoJSON only (no depth data) - drawing happens on 2D maps
- **Dive Site Association**: Routes are linked to dive sites, making them reusable across multiple dives at the same location
- **Route Selection**: Users can select from available routes when creating or editing dives
- **Simplified Storage**: Route data is stored with minimal metadata - difficulty and duration come from dive sites and dives
- **Community Sharing**: Users can browse and select from a community library of available routes for each dive site
- **Smart Deletion**: Routes can be deleted with proper restrictions and migration of associated dives
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-optimized drawing interface that works smoothly on mobile devices
- **Seamless Integration**: Routes are displayed in dive detail pages and can be selected during dive creation

### Route Types

- **Walk Route**: Orange colored segments for surface walking paths
- **Swim Route**: Blue colored segments for surface swimming paths  
- **Scuba Route**: Green colored segments for underwater diving paths
- **Line Route**: Yellow colored segments for general line paths

### Phase 9 E2E Detailed Test Cases (step-by-step)

1) ✅ Route lifecycle (create → view → edit → delete) - **COMPLETED**
   - Navigate to a dive site detail page
   - Click "Draw Route" → draw 2–3 segments (walk/swim/scuba)
   - Save with name and description → expect success toast and route listed
   - Open created route detail page → verify map renders all segments + legend
   - Edit route name/description → save → verify changes persist after reload
   - Delete route (soft delete via Hide) → route disappears from lists
   - Restore route → route reappears in lists and details
   - Hard delete route (no other users' dives) → route removed permanently

2) ✅ Select route on a dive and display on Route tab - **COMPLETED**
   - Create a new dive for the same site → select the created route
   - Save dive → open dive detail → Route tab shows the selected route
   - Refresh the page → verify the same route remains and the map center is correct

3) ✅ Change selected route on existing dive - **COMPLETED**
   - Edit dive → choose a different route → save
   - Visit dive detail → Route tab reflects new route; previous no longer shown

4) ✅ Dive-site routes listing and legend/colors - **COMPLETED**
   - Visit dive site page → verify list of routes shows correct type labels
   - Confirm legend displays only Walk/Swim/Scuba/Line and Mixed (no legacy items)
   - Verify color assignment uses smart detection (not first-segment only)

5) ✅ Export GPX/KML and file content checks - **COMPLETED**
   - From route detail → export GPX → Content-Type starts with application/gpx+xml
   - Open file → confirm segments serialized and route metadata present
   - Export KML → Content-Type starts with application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml
   - Open file → confirm styles/colors per segment type and coordinates correct

6) ✅ Share link - **COMPLETED**
   - Generate share link from route detail
   - Open link in new session (logged out) → route viewable with correct context

7) ✅ Popular routes consistency - **COMPLETED**
   - Associate a few dives with a route → revisit Popular routes
   - Verify route appears with higher ranking than unused routes

8) ✅ Permissions enforcement - **COMPLETED**
   - Log in as a different (non-owner) user
   - Attempt edit/delete of someone else's route → expect 403 Forbidden
   - Admin user can restore/hide appropriately

9) ✅ Soft delete behavior and unlinking - **COMPLETED**
   - Select a route on one dive owned by creator; another dive by a second user
   - Soft-delete route as creator → route hidden; dives should unlink where applicable
   - Restore route → verify relisting

10) ✅ Hard delete with migration option - **COMPLETED**
    - Create Route A and Route B on same site; have dives on Route A
    - Hard delete Route A with migrate_to=B → dives now point to Route B, Route A gone

11) ✅ Analytics tracking non-blocking - **COMPLETED**
    - Trigger view/copy/share actions → verify API returns success
    - Simulate analytics failure (mock) → ensure export/copy/share still succeed

12) ✅ Map stability on refresh/navigation (regression coverage) - **COMPLETED**
    - Directly open dive detail Route tab URL → verify correct map center
    - Navigate to dive detail then to Route tab → consistent map center
    - Refresh Route tab → verify center and segments are stable; no NaN errors

13) ✅ Validation/error cases - **COMPLETED**
    - Attempt to save route with 3D coords → expect error message
    - Save empty features → expect validation error
    - Extremely long names/descriptions → sanitized and truncated per limits

14) ✅ Mobile checks (per matrix) - **COMPLETED**
    - Create/edit routes using touch; verify gestures don't conflict
    - Open route on dive/site pages; verify legend layout and zoom badge
    - Export/share actions usable on mobile

- **Map System**: Integration with existing LeafletMapView component for route display
- **API Layer**: New router following established patterns in `backend/app/routers/`

## User Experience Flow

### Route Creation Flow

1. **User visits dive site detail page** → Sees existing map and dive site information
2. **User clicks "Draw Route" button** → Opens full-screen map interface with drawing tools
3. **User draws route on map** → Uses mouse/touch to create polyline with waypoints
4. **User fills route metadata** → Enters name, description, difficulty, duration, etc.
5. **User saves route** → Route is associated with dive site and becomes available to community

### Route Selection Flow

1. **User creates new dive or edits existing dive** → Navigates to dive creation/edit form
2. **User selects dive site** → System loads available routes for that dive site
3. **User browses available routes** → Views route cards with previews and metadata
4. **User selects a route** → Route is associated with the dive (optional)
5. **User saves dive** → Dive now has selected route for future reference

### Route Display Flow

1. **User views dive detail page** → Sees existing tabs: "Details" and "Profile"
2. **User clicks "Route" tab** → New tab displays selected route with map visualization
3. **User sees route details** → Map shows route path, waypoints, and dive site context
4. **User can interact with route** → Zoom, pan, view waypoint details, export route

## Design Decisions & Simplifications

### Simplified Data Model

- **2D GeoJSON Only**: Routes are drawn on 2D maps without depth data - depth comes from dive records
- **No Duplicate Metadata**: Difficulty and duration are managed at dive site and dive levels, not route level
- **Minimal Schema**: Only essential fields (id, dive_site_id, created_by, name, description, route_data, route_type, timestamps)
- **Soft Delete**: Routes are soft deleted to preserve data integrity and allow restoration

### Route Deletion Strategy

- **Two-Tier Deletion System**:
  - **Soft Delete (Hide)**: Hide routes from new selections, preserve data integrity
  - **Hard Delete (Remove)**: Permanently delete routes, only if no other users' dives use them
- **Permission-Based Access**:
  - **Route Creators**: Can soft delete any route, hard delete only their own dives
  - **Admins**: Can soft delete or hard delete any route with migration
  - **Site Moderators**: Can soft delete routes on sites they moderate
- **Cross-User Protection**: Cannot hard delete routes used by other users' dives
- **Migration Support**: Dives can be migrated to alternative routes before hard deletion
- **Restoration**: Soft-deleted routes can be restored by creators or admins
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents modification of other users' dive data

### Why These Simplifications?

1. **2D Maps**: Drawing happens on 2D maps - depth is a dive property, not a route property
2. **No Data Duplication**: Difficulty/duration are already managed at appropriate levels
3. **Cleaner UX**: Simpler route creation and management
4. **Better Performance**: Smaller database footprint and faster queries
5. **Maintainable**: Less complex code and fewer edge cases

## Technical Requirements & Constraints

### Database Schema

- **Migration Number**: 0035 (next in sequence after 0034)
- **Table Name**: `dive_routes`
- **Route Data Format**: 2D GeoJSON only (no depth data)
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys to `dive_sites.id` and `users.id` (NOT dives.id)
- **Dive Integration**: Add `selected_route_id` foreign key to `dives` table
- **Soft Delete**: `deleted_at` and `deleted_by` fields for safe deletion
- **Indexes**: Performance indexes for `dive_site_id`, `created_by`, `deleted_at`

### Frontend Dependencies

- **Leaflet.draw**: Must be added to `package.json` before Phase 2
- **React Leaflet**: Already available (v4.2.1)
- **Touch Events**: Custom implementation for mobile drawing
- **Performance**: Max 1000 routes per viewport (following existing map limits)

### API Endpoints

- **Base Path**: `/api/v1/dive-routes`
- **Authentication**: JWT token required for create/update/delete
- **Rate Limiting**: Follow existing patterns from other routers
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with existing API error responses

### Mobile Requirements

- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile interaction
- **Performance**: Smooth drawing on devices with 2GB+ RAM
- **Responsive**: Works on screens 320px+ width
- **Offline**: Basic route viewing when offline (cached data)

### Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all route data
- **Permission Checks**: Users can only edit their own routes
- **Data Sanitization**: Prevent XSS in route metadata
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of route creation endpoints

## Review

- [x] **CRITICAL BUG**: Multi-segment routes lose drawn segments when switching route types (walk → swim → scuba)
- [x] **ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE**: Drawing controls are recreated when routeType changes, destroying existing segments
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: useEffect dependencies include routeType, causing complete system recreation
- [x] **SOLUTION**: Complete architectural rewrite to separate drawing infrastructure from segment management

### Comprehensive Fix Plan

#### **Root Cause Analysis**

The problem is **architectural**: we're treating route type changes as requiring complete recreation of the drawing system, when we should treat it as just a color/style change for NEW segments only.

#### **Core Issues**

1. **Drawing Controls Recreation**: `useEffect` recreates entire system when `routeType` changes
2. **FeatureGroup Destruction**: Existing drawn items are lost when controls are recreated  
3. **State Synchronization**: No proper sync between React state and Leaflet layers
4. **Color Application**: Colors are baked into drawing controls instead of applied dynamically

#### **Architectural Solution**

**Phase 1: Restructure State Management**

- Remove internal `routeType` state from `MultiSegmentRouteCanvas`
- Add `segments` state to track all drawn segments with their types and colors
- Create `onDrawCreated` callback with proper dependencies using `useCallback`

**Phase 2: Fix MapInitializer Architecture**

- Change `useEffect` dependencies to `[diveSite, onDrawCreated]` (NOT `routeType`)
- Create persistent FeatureGroup that never gets recreated
- Add segment restoration logic to restore existing segments on initialization
- Remove `routeType` from drawing control configuration

**Phase 3: Implement Segment Management**

- Add segment list UI with type indicators, color swatches, and delete buttons
- Add segment count display and clear all functionality
- Ensure proper cleanup and state synchronization between React and Leaflet

**Phase 4: Testing and Validation**

- Test complete workflow: walk → swim → scuba segments
- Verify segments persist when switching route types
- Verify color application matches legend
- Verify segment management works properly

#### **Key Technical Changes**

1. **State Management**:

   ```javascript
   // MultiSegmentRouteCanvas
   const [segments, setSegments] = useState([]); // Track all segments
   const onDrawCreated = useCallback((e) => {
     // Apply current routeType color to new segment
     // Add to persistent FeatureGroup
     // Update segments state
   }, [routeType, diveSite, setSegments]);
   ```

2. **MapInitializer Architecture**:

   ```javascript
   // MapInitializer
   useEffect(() => {
     // Initialize drawing controls ONCE
     // Create persistent FeatureGroup
     // Restore existing segments
     // Set up event handlers
   }, [diveSite, onDrawCreated]); // NOT routeType
   ```

3. **Segment Management**:

   ```javascript
   // Segment restoration
   segments.forEach(segment => {
     const layer = L.geoJSON(segment.geometry);
     layer.setStyle({ color: segment.properties.color });
     drawnItemsRef.current.addLayer(layer);
   });
   ```

#### **Expected User Workflow**

1. Select "Multi" mode → Select "Walk Route" → Draw walk segment (orange)
2. Select "Swim Route" → Walk segment remains visible → Draw swim segment (blue)  
3. Select "Scuba Route" → Both segments remain visible → Draw scuba segment (green)
4. See all segments with different colors → Manage segments → Save complete route

This is a **complete architectural rewrite** that addresses the root cause rather than symptoms. The solution separates drawing infrastructure (stable) from segment management (dynamic), ensuring segments persist across route type changes.

## Notes

### Recent Simplification (December 2024)

Based on user feedback that the dive site routes display was over-complicated for typical usage (2-3 routes per site), the following simplifications were implemented:

- **Removed Complex Filtering**: Eliminated search, filtering, and sorting functionality from DiveSiteRoutes component
- **Removed RouteRecommendations**: Deleted the RouteRecommendations component and sidebar sections
- **Simplified Route Display**: Routes now display in a clean, simple list format using RoutePreview component
- **Fixed Critical Bug**: Resolved infinite recursion error in RoutePreview component caused by naming conflict
- **Maintained Core Functionality**: Route creation, viewing, editing, copying, sharing, and deletion still work perfectly

The simplified design is more appropriate for real-world usage where dive sites typically have 2-3 routes, providing a faster, cleaner user experience.

### Recent Feature Simplification (January 2025)

Based on user feedback that certain route features were unnecessary for typical usage, the following simplifications were implemented:

- **Removed Bookmark Feature**: Eliminated route bookmarking functionality from RoutePreview component and backend API
- **Removed Verification Feature**: Eliminated route verification system and related UI elements
- **Removed Analytics Display**: Removed user-facing analytics features while maintaining backend tracking capabilities
- **Simplified Share Functionality**: Streamlined sharing to simple URL copying instead of complex sharing system
- **Maintained Core Functionality**: Route creation, viewing, editing, copying, and deletion still work perfectly
- **Enhanced Route Management**: Improved route editing interface with better metadata management and validation
- **Improved Map Integration**: Enhanced dive site maps with route layer display, toggle controls, and route legends

The streamlined design focuses on essential functionality, providing a cleaner and more focused user experience for route management.

### Route Minimap Feature Implementation (January 2025)

- **Backend API**: Complete CRUD operations with soft delete support and community features
- **Database Schema**: DiveRoute model with 2D GeoJSON storage

## Architectural Changes Required

### Single Segment Route Removal

**CRITICAL**: Completely remove single segment dive route functionality and rename multi-segment routes to just "dive routes".

#### Changes Required

1. **Backend Changes**:
   - Remove `RouteType` enum values for single segment routes
   - Update database schema to remove single segment route support
   - Update API endpoints to only handle multi-segment routes
   - Remove single segment route validation logic

2. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Remove `RouteDrawingCanvas.js` component entirely
   - Rename `MultiSegmentRouteCanvas.js` to `RouteCanvas.js`
   - Update all references from "multi-segment" to just "route"
   - Remove single segment route UI elements and logic
   - Update route creation forms to only support multi-segment

3. **Database Changes**:
   - Update migration to remove single segment route support
   - Update existing route data to use multi-segment format
   - Remove single segment route constraints

4. **UI/UX Changes**:
   - Update all user-facing text to remove "multi-segment" terminology
   - Simplify route creation interface to only show segment types
   - Update route display components to handle only multi-segment format

#### Rationale

- Multi-segment routes already work correctly and can handle single segments
- Single segment routes have repeatedly failed to work as expected
- Simplifying to one route type reduces complexity and maintenance burden
- Users can create single-segment routes by only drawing one segment type

## Recent Changes & Updates

### Phase 9: Testing & Performance - COMPLETED ✅

**All testing and performance validation completed successfully:**

- **✅ Comprehensive E2E Testing**: 10/10 core flows completed across desktop and mobile
- **✅ Performance Testing**: 1000+ routes tested with excellent performance metrics
- **✅ Mobile Device Testing**: Responsive design, touch interactions, mobile navigation verified
- **✅ Route Data Validation**: GeoJSON validation, export format validation, error handling completed
- **✅ XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and security measures implemented

### Phase 10: Security & Polish - IN PROGRESS 🔄

**Security Testing & Vulnerability Assessment - COMPLETED ✅**

- **✅ Authentication & Authorization**: Public endpoints accessible, protected endpoints require auth
- **✅ Input Validation & Security**: XSS prevention, SQL injection protection, input sanitization
- **✅ Rate Limiting**: Admin users exempt, regular users rate limited appropriately
- **✅ Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved backend validation error preventing API access

**Remaining Tasks:**
- [ ] User acceptance testing and feedback integration
- [ ] Update documentation and user guides
- [ ] Final bug fixes and performance optimization

### Critical Bug Fixes Applied

#### Backend Validation Error Resolution
**Issue**: Backend validation error preventing API access due to existing route data with different coordinate formats
**Root Cause**: Existing routes had Polygon geometry with triple-nested coordinate arrays `[[[lon, lat], ...]]` while validation expected LineString format `[[lon, lat], ...]`
**Solution**: Enhanced validation logic to handle different geometry types (LineString, Polygon, Point, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon)
**Result**: API now works correctly with all existing data while maintaining security

#### XSS Prevention Enhancement
**Issue**: Need to ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized
**Solution**: Confirmed XSS prevention working correctly - script tags properly escaped (`&lt;script&gt;`)
**Result**: All user inputs safely sanitized and displayed

#### Utility Scripts Security Enhancement
**Issue**: Utility scripts contained hardcoded admin passwords, creating security risks
**Solution**: Updated all utility scripts to use environment variables for credentials with secure defaults
**Result**: 
- All scripts now support `ADMIN_USER`, `ADMIN_PASS`, `TEST_USER`, `TEST_PASS`, `BASE_URL` environment variables
- Default admin password (`admin123`) intentionally does NOT work - forces users to set correct password via environment variable
- Created comprehensive documentation (`utils/README_credentials.md`) with clear warnings about required environment variables
- Scripts are now production-safe and CI/CD ready with proper credential management
