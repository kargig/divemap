# Implement dive route drawing and selection system

**Status:** Refining
**Created:** 2025-09-29T01:53:27Z
**Agent PID:** 661645
**Branch:** feature/dive-route-drawing-implementation

## Description

Implement a dive route drawing and selection system that allows users to draw their exact dive paths on dive site maps and share them with the community. The system will build upon the existing Leaflet mapping infrastructure and integrate seamlessly with the current dive logging and dive site management systems.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Route Drawing**: Users can draw dive routes directly on dive site maps using mouse and touch interactions
- **Dive Association**: Each route is linked to a specific dive ID and dive site for proper organization
- **Database Storage**: Route data is stored with proper relationships to dives and dive sites using GeoJSON format
- **Community Sharing**: Users can browse and select from a community library of available routes
- **Route Management**: Easy editing, deletion, and metadata management for user-created routes
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-optimized drawing interface that works smoothly on mobile devices
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing dive site pages and dive detail pages

- [ ] Integration with existing features is seamless

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database & Backend Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create migration `0035_add_dive_routes_table.py` with GeoJSON route data storage
- [ ] Add `DiveRoute` SQLAlchemy model with proper relationships to `Dive` and `User`
- [ ] Create Pydantic schemas for route data validation and API responses
- [ ] Implement CRUD API endpoints for route management (`/api/v1/dive-routes`)
- [ ] Add route search and filtering capabilities with pagination
- [ ] Implement route interaction endpoints (view, verify, copy, share)
- [ ] Add route validation logic for geometry and metadata
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for backend functionality
- [ ] Add route endpoints to existing dive site and dive detail APIs

### Phase 2: Core Drawing Interface & Mobile Support (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Install and configure Leaflet.draw plugin in frontend
- [ ] Create RouteDrawingCanvas component with touch/mouse support
- [ ] Implement real-time route preview during drawing
- [ ] Add route editing and management interface
- [ ] Integrate drawing canvas with existing dive site maps
- [ ] Add route snapping to existing dive site markers
- [ ] Implement mobile-optimized touch drawing interface
- [ ] Add route validation on frontend (geometry, metadata)
- [ ] Create route data compression utilities
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Phase 3: Route Discovery & Integration (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Create RouteSelectionInterface component for browsing routes
- [ ] Add routes section to dive site detail pages (`/dive-sites/{id}`)
- [ ] Add routes section to dive detail pages (`/dives/{id}`)
- [ ] Implement route filtering and search functionality
- [ ] Create route preview and details modal
- [ ] Add route sharing and community features
- [ ] Integrate route display with existing LeafletMapView component
- [ ] Add route analytics and usage tracking
- [ ] Implement route export functionality

### Phase 4: Testing, Performance & Polish (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Comprehensive end-to-end testing across all devices
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets (1000+ routes)
- [ ] Mobile device testing and optimization
- [ ] Route data validation and quality checks
- [ ] Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] User acceptance testing and feedback integration
- [ ] Update documentation and user guides
- [ ] Final bug fixes and performance optimization

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Technical Dependencies
- **Leaflet.draw plugin**: Must be installed before Phase 2
- **Migration 0035**: Must be created and tested before Phase 1 completion
- **Existing API patterns**: Follow established router patterns from `dive_sites.py`
- **Mobile testing devices**: Required for Phase 2 and 4

### Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Backend APIs must be complete before frontend integration
- **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: Drawing interface must be functional before discovery features
- **Phase 3 → Phase 4**: All features must be implemented before final testing
- **Continuous**: Testing and mobile optimization throughout all phases

### Integration Points
- **Dive Site Pages**: Routes section added to existing dive site detail pages
- **Dive Detail Pages**: Routes section added to existing dive detail pages  
- **Map System**: Integration with existing LeafletMapView component
- **API Layer**: New router following established patterns in `backend/app/routers/`

## Technical Requirements & Constraints

### Database Schema
- **Migration Number**: 0035 (next in sequence after 0034)
- **Table Name**: `dive_routes`
- **Route Data Format**: GeoJSON with waypoint support
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys to `dives.id` and `users.id`
- **Indexes**: Performance indexes for `dive_id`, `created_by`, `is_public`, `difficulty_level`

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Leaflet.draw**: Must be added to `package.json` before Phase 2
- **React Leaflet**: Already available (v4.2.1)
- **Touch Events**: Custom implementation for mobile drawing
- **Performance**: Max 1000 routes per viewport (following existing map limits)

### API Endpoints
- **Base Path**: `/api/v1/dive-routes`
- **Authentication**: JWT token required for create/update/delete
- **Rate Limiting**: Follow existing patterns from other routers
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with existing API error responses

### Mobile Requirements
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile interaction
- **Performance**: Smooth drawing on devices with 2GB+ RAM
- **Responsive**: Works on screens 320px+ width
- **Offline**: Basic route viewing when offline (cached data)

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all route data
- **Permission Checks**: Users can only edit their own routes
- **Data Sanitization**: Prevent XSS in route metadata
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of route creation endpoints
