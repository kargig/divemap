## Original Todo
See `plan.md` for current status and technical details.

## Description
Implement unified fuzzy search for the Dives page (`/dives`) to match the existing fuzzy search implementation used in Diving Centers, Dive Sites, and Dive Trips. This will provide consistent search experience with unified scoring, match type badges, and mobile-optimized interfaces.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Functional: Dives page supports unified + fuzzy search with ranking
- [x] Functional: Search works with dive site names, descriptions, and related fields
- [x] Functional: Match type badges display correctly (exact_phrase, exact_words, partial_words, similar, fuzzy)
- [x] Functional: Search suggestions work with real-time highlighting
- [x] Quality: Performance acceptable (no timeouts; pagination works)
- [x] Quality: Lint/tests pass; no regressions in existing search functionality
- [x] User validation: Search behavior consistent with other pages (Diving Centers, Dive Sites, Dive Trips)

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Backend: Add unified search support to `/api/v1/dives/` endpoint
- [x] Backend: Implement `calculate_unified_phrase_aware_score` for dive fields (dive_site_name, description, etc.)
- [x] Backend: Add fuzzy search triggers and result ranking for dives
- [x] Frontend: Replace basic search input with `FuzzySearchInput` component in Dives page
- [x] Frontend: Add `MatchTypeBadge` display for search results
- [x] Frontend: Wire search state, debouncing, and real-time suggestions
- [x] Testing: Validate search relevance with sample dive queries

## Automated test
- [ ] Backend tests for endpoints and ranking stability

## User test
- [x] Test dive search with various queries (dive site names, partial matches, typos)
- [x] Verify search suggestions and highlighting work correctly
- [x] Confirm search behavior matches other pages (Diving Centers, Dive Sites, Dive Trips)

## Review
- [x] Bug that needs fixing: None found
- [x] Code that needs cleanup: None required

## Notes
- Trigger fuzzy when results < threshold or multi-word queries
