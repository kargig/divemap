**Status:** In Progress - Core functionality complete, all critical issues resolved, minor cleanup remaining
**Created:** 2025-09-13-23-09-03
**Started:** 2025-09-13T23:10:19+03:00
**Agent PID:** 62461

## Original Todo

Migrate TripMap.js from OpenLayers to Leaflet to enable complete removal of OpenLayers dependencies and unify all map implementations under Leaflet.

## Description

**UPDATED DIRECTION**: Refactor towards a unified map architecture that eliminates redundancy between TripMapLeaflet and IndependentMapView. The current architecture has two separate map components:

1. **TripMapLeaflet**: Specialized for dive-trips within DiveTrips page
2. **IndependentMapView**: Generic map supporting dive-sites, diving-centers, dives

**New Approach**: Create a single unified map component that dynamically adapts based on entity type, with trip-specific features only when needed. This will:

- Eliminate code duplication between map components
- Add dive-trips support to IndependentMapView
- Simplify maintenance and future development
- Provide consistent map experience across all entity types
- Enable complete removal of OpenLayers dependencies

**Key Features to Preserve**:

- Trip status-based icon colors (scheduled/confirmed/cancelled/completed)
- Trip-specific filtering (price, status, diving center, dive sites)
- Trip popup with detailed trip information
- Status toggle filtering logic
- Trip-specific coordinate grouping and clustering
- Complex popup system with trip details, dive site information, and navigation links

   - **Solution**: Implemented share-only viewport querying approach
   - **Implementation**:
     - Disabled automatic viewport change detection (`shouldRefetch = false`)
     - Removed `debouncedViewport` from `useQuery` dependency array
     - Added `MapInstanceCapture` component to capture Leaflet map instance
     - Modified `generateShareUrl` to query current viewport only when share button clicked
   - **Result**: Map movements are now completely smooth with no loading states
   - **Technical Details**:
     - Data loads only once on initial load and when filters/entity type changes
     - Increased cache times (5 minutes stale, 10 minutes cache)
     - Increased debounce time to 1 second
     - Share functionality captures real-time viewport (lat, lng, zoom)

2. **✅ API Rate Limiting (429 errors) - RESOLVED**
   - **Solution**: Dramatically reduced API calls through share-only approach
   - **Result**: No more 429 errors due to excessive API requests
   - **Technical Details**: Minimal API calls prevent rate limiting issues

**Key Performance Improvements**:

- **Smooth Map Interaction**: Users can zoom and pan without any loading states
- **Efficient Data Loading**: Data loads only when necessary (initial load, filter changes)
- **Smart Caching**: Extended cache times reduce redundant API calls
- **Share Functionality**: Real-time viewport capture for accurate URL sharing
- **No Rate Limiting**: Minimal API calls prevent backend overload

**Technical Implementation Details**:

- **Share-Only Viewport Querying**: Map instance captured and queried only when share button clicked

   - [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

### 🎉 MAJOR SUCCESS: Critical Performance Issues Resolved

The implementation has successfully resolved all critical UX issues:

- **✅ Smooth Map Movement**: No more "Loading map data..." during zoom/pan operations
- **✅ Efficient Data Loading**: Data loads only when necessary, not on every viewport change
- **✅ Share Functionality**: Real-time viewport capture provides accurate sharing URLs
- **✅ No Rate Limiting**: Dramatically reduced API calls prevent 429 errors
- **✅ User Experience**: Map interactions are now fast and responsive

The solution implements a **share-only viewport querying approach** where:

1. Map data loads once on initial load and when filters change
2. Users can interact with the map smoothly without loading states
3. Share button captures current viewport state when clicked
4. Minimal API calls prevent backend overload and rate limiting

This represents a significant improvement in user experience and system performance.

**Phase 4 - Component Cleanup (Completed):**

### ✅ TripMapLeaflet Component Removal

1. **✅ Removed TripMapLeaflet.js component** - No longer needed since unified map handles all entity types
2. **✅ Updated DiveTrips.js integration** - Replaced map view with redirect to unified map at `/map?type=dive-trips`
3. **✅ Cleaned up unused state and functions** - Removed map-specific state variables and handlers
4. **✅ Improved user experience** - Users get redirected to the more feature-rich unified map

**Key Changes Made**:

- Deleted `frontend/src/components/TripMapLeaflet.js` (844 lines removed)
- Updated `DiveTrips.js` to redirect map view to unified map
- Removed unused state: `mappedTripsCount`, `statusToggles`, `clustering`, `showMapInfo`, `viewport`
- Removed unused functions: `handleMappedTripsCountChange`
- Added user-friendly redirect interface with clear call-to-action buttons

**Result**: Complete elimination of code duplication between map components while maintaining all functionality through the unified map system.

**Phase 5 - Geolocation Enhancement (Completed):**

### ✅ Geolocation System Refactoring

1. **✅ Replaced manual geolocation with react-geolocated library**
   - **Problem**: Manual geolocation implementation had browser compatibility issues, especially with Firefox
   - **Solution**: Adopted `react-geolocated` library for robust cross-browser geolocation support
   - **Implementation**:
     - Installed `react-geolocated` package in frontend container
     - Replaced manual `navigator.geolocation` calls with `useGeolocated` hook
     - Added retry logic for `POSITION_UNAVAILABLE` errors (up to 3 attempts)
     - Implemented Firefox-specific debugging and adaptive `maximumAge` options
     - Added proper error handling for all geolocation error types

2. **✅ Enhanced geolocation error handling**
   - **Error Types Handled**:
     - `PERMISSION_DENIED` (Code 1): User denied location access
     - `POSITION_UNAVAILABLE` (Code 2): Location unavailable (with retry logic)
     - `TIMEOUT` (Code 3): Location request timed out
   - **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts for `POSITION_UNAVAILABLE` with 2-second delays
   - **Firefox Compatibility**: Added specific debugging and `maximumAge` handling for Firefox
   - **User Experience**: Clear error messages and fallback to default viewport

3. **✅ Improved geolocation state management**
   - **State Simplification**: Replaced manual state management with `useGeolocated` hook
   - **Request Handling**: Added `isRequestingLocation` state for UI feedback
   - **Auto-Request**: Geolocation automatically requested on map load if no URL viewport exists
   - **Fallback Behavior**: Graceful fallback to default viewport if geolocation fails

**Phase 6 - Rate Limiting Optimization (Completed):**

### ✅ Backend Rate Limiting Improvements

1. **✅ Enhanced rate limiting logging**
   - **Problem**: Excessive `[RATE_LIMIT]` logs cluttering backend output
   - **Solution**: Implemented intelligent logging with deduplication
   - **Implementation**:
     - Added function name and endpoint information to rate limiting logs
     - Implemented deduplication mechanism to log each unique request only once
     - Added periodic cleanup of logged requests (every 5 minutes)
     - Streamlined console output for better readability

2. **✅ Reduced redundant logging**
   - **Key Function Logging**: Removed excessive timing logs from `custom_key_func`
   - **Deduplication**: Only log "Applying rate limiting" message once per unique request
   - **Clean Logs**: Backend now shows clean, meaningful rate limiting information
   - **Performance**: Reduced log spam while maintaining useful debugging information

**Phase 7 - Leaflet Marker Error Resolution (Completed):**

### ✅ Fixed Critical Leaflet Marker Positioning Error

1. **✅ Resolved `Cannot set properties of undefined (setting '_leaflet_pos')` error**
   - **Problem**: Race condition when navigating to map page caused marker positioning errors
   - **Root Cause**: Improper cleanup of marker clusters and invalid marker data
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive marker and cluster management improvements

2. **✅ Enhanced cluster group cleanup**
   - **Implementation**:
     - Added proper cleanup of existing clusters before creating new ones
     - Implemented `clearLayers()` and `removeLayer()` with error handling
     - Added null checks and proper cleanup on component unmount
     - Prevented memory leaks from orphaned cluster groups

3. **✅ Added marker validation and error handling**
   - **Validation**: Check marker positions are valid arrays of two numbers
   - **Error Handling**: Wrapped marker creation in try-catch blocks
   - **Race Condition Prevention**: Added 50ms setTimeout delay during cluster creation
   - **Graceful Degradation**: Invalid markers are warned and skipped, not crash the map

4. **✅ Improved map stability**
   - **Navigation**: Fixed errors when navigating from `/diving-centers` to `/map?type=diving-centers`
   - **Entity Switching**: Prevented race conditions when switching between entity types
   - **Error Recovery**: Map continues to function even if some markers fail to load
   - **User Experience**: Smooth navigation between pages without JavaScript errors

**Technical Implementation Details**:

- **Cluster Management**: Proper cleanup prevents `_leaflet_pos` errors
- **Marker Validation**: Ensures only valid coordinates are processed
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Timeout delays prevent timing issues
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks around all marker operations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

**Result**: Map navigation is now completely stable with no JavaScript errors, proper marker display, and smooth transitions between different entity types.

**Phase 8 - Rate Limiting System Fix (Completed):**

### ✅ Fixed Critical Rate Limiting Bug

1. **✅ Resolved rate limiting decorator bug**
   - **Problem**: Rate limiting was blocking requests after only 4-5 successful requests instead of the configured 250/minute limit
   - **Root Cause**: `skip_rate_limit_for_admin` decorator was creating new rate limited functions on every request instead of once during decoration
   - **Solution**: Moved rate limited function creation to decorator level for proper reuse

2. **✅ Fixed rate limiting accuracy**
   - **Before Fix**: Only 4-5 requests allowed before rate limiting kicked in
   - **After Fix**: Exactly 250 requests allowed before rate limiting (as configured)
   - **Verification**: Comprehensive testing confirmed proper request counting and rate limit enforcement

3. **✅ Enhanced rate limiting testing**
   - **Test Coverage**: Created comprehensive test suite to verify rate limiting behavior
   - **IP Isolation**: Confirmed different IP addresses have separate rate limit buckets
   - **Accuracy Testing**: Verified all 250 requests within limit are successful
   - **Logging Verification**: Confirmed clean, informative rate limiting logs

4. **✅ Improved system performance**
   - **Proper Request Counting**: Rate limiting now accurately tracks requests per IP
   - **Correct Rate Limits**: 250 requests per minute limit enforced correctly
   - **Clean Logging**: Reduced log spam with deduplication while maintaining useful debugging info
   - **Admin Exemptions**: Localhost and admin user exemptions working correctly

**Technical Implementation Details**:

- **Decorator Fix**: Moved `limiter.limit(limit_string)(func)` creation to decorator level
- **Function Reuse**: Rate limited functions now created once and reused for all requests
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cleanup mechanisms prevent memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all rate limiting scenarios

**Result**: Rate limiting system now works correctly with proper request counting, accurate rate limits, and clean logging. All 250 requests per minute are allowed before rate limiting kicks in, exactly as configured.

## OpenLayers → Leaflet Migration Status

The goal is to completely remove OpenLayers from the frontend and standardize on Leaflet/react-leaflet.

### Completed (migrated to Leaflet)

- [x] `frontend/src/components/MiniMap.js` → Leaflet with `MapContainer`, `TileLayer`, `Marker`, modal maximize, responsive height tweaks
- [x] `frontend/src/pages/DiveSiteMap.js` → Leaflet full-screen map with popups, default zoom 16, defensive coordinate handling, close button overlay, distinct main-site marker styling

### Pending (still using OpenLayers)

- [ ] `frontend/src/components/DiveSitesMap.js` (OL)
- [ ] `frontend/src/components/DivingCentersMap.js` (OL)
- [ ] `frontend/src/components/DivesMap.js` (OL)
- [ ] `frontend/src/components/DiveTripsMap.js` (OL)
- [ ] `frontend/src/components/DiveMap.js` (OL)
- [ ] `frontend/src/components/UnifiedMapView.js` (OL; candidate for replacement with `LeafletMapView` or consolidation)

### Cleanup

- [ ] Verify no remaining `ol/*` imports after the above migrations
- [ ] Remove OpenLayers from `package.json` dependencies once code is clean
- [ ] Remove any dead OL-specific utilities/styles

### Notes on Implementation

- Leaflet default marker icons are configured via CDN URLs to avoid bundler asset issues
- Popups provide clickable links to entity detail pages and display coordinates
- Defensive guards ensure maps render even when coordinates are missing (fall back to Athens center)
