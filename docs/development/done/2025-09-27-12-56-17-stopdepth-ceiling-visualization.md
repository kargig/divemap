**Agent PID:** 498724
**Branch:** feature/stopdepth-ceiling-visualization

## Original Todo

- **Add stopdepth ceiling visualization to dive profile charts**
  - When a profile sample has in_deco='1', it also has a stopdepth value indicating the maximum depth the diver should not exceed
  - Visualize stopdepth values as a ceiling/area graph in the top part of the dive profile visualization
  - When a sample doesn't include stopdepth, use the previous value (stopdepth persists until changed)
  - Before in_deco=1, stopdepth should be zero
  - After in_deco=0, stopdepth should be zero again
  - This will help divers understand their decompression ceiling requirements during the dive

## Description

The dive profile visualization currently shows depth, temperature, and decompression status, but lacks visualization of the decompression ceiling (stopdepth) and mandatory stop times (stoptime). When divers are in decompression (in_deco=1), they have a maximum depth they cannot exceed (stopdepth), which acts as a "ceiling" during ascent, and a mandatory time they must spend at that ceiling (stoptime) before ascending further. Both values persist until the decompression obligation ends (in_deco=0).

We need to add a visual ceiling/area graph that shows the stopdepth constraint, helping divers understand their decompression requirements and safety limits. The visualization should be positioned above the depth line, showing the "safe zone" between the actual depth and the ceiling, with clear visual indicators for when divers are approaching or exceeding their decompression limits. Additionally, we need to display the stoptime information in the tooltip to help divers understand how long they must remain at the current ceiling before ascending.

This feature enhances diver safety by providing immediate visual feedback about decompression constraints during dive profile review.

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [x] **Stopdepth ceiling visualization**: Area graph shows stopdepth values as a ceiling constraint above the depth line
- [x] **Decompression state handling**: When in_deco=1 and stopdepth present, ceiling is displayed at stopdepth value
- [x] **Stopdepth persistence logic**: When in_deco=1 but no stopdepth in sample, previous stopdepth value is maintained
- [x] **Surface state**: Before any in_deco=1, stopdepth ceiling is at zero (surface level)
- [x] **End state**: After in_deco=0, stopdepth ceiling returns to zero (surface level)
- [x] **Stoptime tooltip**: Display stoptime in tooltip when in decompression
- [x] **Stoptime persistence**: Stoptime carries forward when not present in sample
- [x] **Stoptime reset**: Stoptime disappears when exiting decompression
- [x] **Stoptime formatting**: Display stoptime in user-friendly time format (minutes:seconds)
- [x] **Visual clarity**: Ceiling area is visually distinct and doesn't obscure the depth line
- [x] **Mobile compatibility**: Touch interactions work correctly with the new area visualization
- [x] **Conditional display**: If dive profile does not have in_deco='1', don't show ceiling line at all
- [x] **Toggleable tooltip fields**: CNS, Ceiling, and Stop Time can be toggled on/off to reduce clutter
- [x] **Mobile landscape suggestion**: Suggest mobile users rotate to landscape for better chart view

### Quality Requirements

- [x] **Code quality**: All existing tests continue to pass
- [x] **Linting**: ESLint validation passes in frontend container
- [x] **Performance**: Chart rendering performance is not significantly impacted
- [x] **Accessibility**: Visualization is accessible and follows existing accessibility patterns

### User Validation

- [x] **Manual testing**: Test with dive profile containing decompression stops
- [x] **Manual testing**: Test with dive profile without decompression stops
- [x] **Mobile testing**: Verify mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
- [x] **Export testing**: PNG/PDF export includes stopdepth visualization
