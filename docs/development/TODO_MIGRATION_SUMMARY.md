# TODO Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of old TODO and implementation plan files to the new Todo Implementation Program structure as defined in `.cursor/rules/todo-implementation.mdc`.

## Migration Rationale

The old structure had implementation plans and TODO documents scattered throughout `docs/development/`, making it difficult to:
- Track active vs. completed work
- Maintain consistent task management
- Enable concurrent work on different tasks
- Follow structured implementation workflows

## New Structure

### `docs/development/todo.md`
- **Purpose**: Centralized list of active tasks and priorities
- **Format**: Clean, organized list with status and priority levels
- **Updates**: Should be updated as tasks are completed or new ones added

### `docs/development/work/`
- **Purpose**: Active work in progress
- **Format**: Each task gets its own folder with `task.md` following the Todo Implementation Program structure
- **Workflow**: Tasks move through Refining â†’ In Progress â†’ Review â†’ Done phases

### `docs/development/done/`
- **Purpose**: Completed tasks and implementation plans
- **Format**: Historical record of completed work
- **Reference**: Can be consulted for similar future implementations

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Separation**: Active work vs. completed work
2. **Structured Workflow**: Each task follows the same implementation phases
3. **Better Tracking**: Clear status and progress tracking
4. **Concurrent Work**: Multiple developers can work on different tasks
5. **Historical Record**: Completed work preserved for reference
6. **Consistent Format**: All tasks follow the same structure and format

## Next Steps

1. **Active Tasks**: Convert remaining work files to proper `task.md` format
2. **New Tasks**: Use the Todo Implementation Program workflow for new tasks
3. **Maintenance**: Keep `todo.md` updated as tasks are completed
4. **Documentation**: Update this summary as the structure evolves

## Workflow for New Tasks

When creating new tasks:
1. Create folder in `docs/development/work/[task-name]/`
2. Create `task.md` following the Todo Implementation Program template
3. Add task to `docs/development/todo.md`
4. Follow the Refining â†’ In Progress â†’ Review â†’ Done workflow
5. Move completed task to `docs/development/done/`

This ensures all development work follows a consistent, trackable, and maintainable process.
