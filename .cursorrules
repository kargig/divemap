# Cursor Rules for Divemap Project

## Environment Management

### Virtual Environment Requirements
- **NEVER install Python packages in the system Python**
- **ALWAYS use docker containers named divemap_db, divemap_frontend, divemap_backend to execute commands**
- **NEVER try to start frontend, backend or database on the system**
- **ALWAYS use virtual environments for Python development**
- **ALWAYS activate the virtual environment before installing packages**
- **NEVER install npm packages globally**
- **ALWAYS use project-specific node_modules**

### Python Development
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Always use virtual environment
cd backend
source divemap_venv/bin/activate
pip install package_name

# ❌ WRONG - Never install in system Python
pip install package_name  # This is forbidden
```

### Node.js Development
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use local node_modules
npm install package_name

# ❌ WRONG - Never install globally
npm install -g package_name  # This is forbidden
```

## Database Migration Rules

### Alembic Migration Requirements
- **MUST always take a full mysql backup BEFORE any database schema changes and name it according to the latest git commit**
- **MUST use Alembic for ALL database schema changes**
- **NEVER modify database schema manually**
- **ALWAYS create migrations for schema changes**
- **ALWAYS test migrations before applying**
- **ALWAYS restore the most recent database backup when a migration script fails, and then try again with any necessary changes**

### Migration Workflow
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use Alembic for migrations
cd backend
source divemap_venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="/home/kargig/src/divemap/backend/divemap_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"

# Create new migration
python create_migration.py "Description of changes"

# Run migrations
python run_migrations.py

# ❌ WRONG - Never modify database manually
# Direct SQL ALTER TABLE statements are forbidden
```

### Migration Best Practices
- Always review auto-generated migrations
- Test migrations on development database first
- Backup production database before migrations
- Use descriptive migration names
- Handle dependencies between migrations

### Migration Filename Requirements
- **MUST always use numerical ordering for migration filenames**
- **MUST follow the format: `####_descriptive_name.py` where #### is a 4-digit number**
- **MUST ensure sequential numbering (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)**
- **MUST use descriptive names that clearly indicate the migration purpose**
- **NEVER use hash-based filenames (like `abc123_description.py`)**
- **NEVER use non-numerical prefixes or random strings**
- **ALWAYS check existing migration numbers before creating new ones**
- **ALWAYS rename any migration files that don't follow this pattern**

### Migration Filename Examples
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Numerical ordering with descriptive names
0001_initial.py
0002_add_max_depth_and_alternative_names.py
0003_add_country_region_fields.py
0004_add_view_count_fields.py
0005_add_user_diving_fields.py
0006_add_diving_organizations_and_user_certifications.py
0007_remove_unnecessary_certification_fields.py

# ❌ WRONG - Hash-based or non-numerical filenames
c85d7af66778_add_diving_organizations_and_user_.py
abc123_description.py
add_dive_name_and_privacy.py
consolidated_dive_system_final.py
```

### Migration Filename Workflow
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Check existing migrations before creating new ones
cd backend/migrations/versions
ls -la *.py | grep -E '^[0-9]{4}_' | sort

# Find the next available number
# If highest is 0017, use 0018 for the next migration

# ❌ WRONG - Don't use random or hash-based names
# Don't create: abc123_description.py
# Don't create: add_something.py
```

## Git Commit Rules

### Git Commit Requirements
- **NEVER commit to git automatically**
- **ONLY commit when explicitly requested by the user**
- **NEVER commit automatically after being previously asked to commit once, ALWAYS ask the user**
- **ALWAYS ask for permission before committing**
- **ALWAYS provide clear commit messages when requested**

### Git Workflow
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Only commit when user requests
# Wait for user to say: "commit these changes"

# ❌ WRONG - Never commit automatically
git add . && git commit -m "auto commit"  # This is forbidden
```

### Commit Guidelines (when user requests)
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Include affected files in commit message
- Reference issue numbers if applicable
- Test changes before committing

### The Seven Rules of Great Git Commit Messages
Based on [Chris Beams' guidelines](https://gist.github.com/julienbourdeau/e605e4b8b47da97c249a0f72598529c8), all commit messages MUST follow these 7 rules:

1. **Separate subject from body with a blank line**
   - Subject line should be followed by a blank line
   - Body should start after the blank line

2. **Limit the subject line to 50 characters**
   - Keep subject line concise and under 50 characters
   - Use body for detailed explanation

3. **Capitalize the subject line**
   - Start subject line with a capital letter
   - Use title case for clarity

4. **Do not end the subject line with a period**
   - Subject line should not end with punctuation
   - Keep it clean and direct

5. **Use the imperative mood in the subject line**
   - Use commands like "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove"
   - Write as if giving instructions

6. **Wrap the body at 72 characters**
   - Keep body text readable in terminal
   - Use line breaks at 72 characters

7. **Use the body to explain what and why vs. how**
   - Focus on what changed and why it was needed
   - Avoid explaining how the change was implemented

### Commit Message Examples
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Following all 7 rules
Add user authentication endpoint

Implement OAuth2 authentication flow for Google login.
This allows users to sign in using their Google accounts
instead of creating separate credentials.

Fixes #123

# ✅ CORRECT - Good subject line
Fix database connection timeout

Increase connection pool size and add retry logic to
handle high traffic periods.

# ❌ WRONG - Violates multiple rules
fixed the bug with user login that was causing problems
when users tried to log in with google accounts.

# ❌ WRONG - Subject too long, no blank line
Add comprehensive user authentication system with OAuth2 support for Google login and session management
```

### Commit Message Template
```bash
# Template to follow:
<imperative verb> <what was changed>

<Detailed explanation of what and why, wrapped at 72 characters>
<Additional context if needed>

<Optional: Fixes #issue_number>
<Optional: Related to #issue_number>
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Environment Rules
- **ALWAYS run tests in virtual environments or within docker container**
- **NEVER run tests in system Python**
- **ALWAYS use project-specific test configurations**
- **ALWAYS use project's testing strategy document for guidance on testing**

### Backend Testing
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use virtual environment for tests
cd backend
source divemap_venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="/home/kargig/src/divemap/backend/divemap_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# ❌ WRONG - Never test in system Python
python -m pytest  # This is forbidden
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use local node_modules
npm test
node validate_frontend.js
node test_regressions.js

# ❌ WRONG - Never use global packages
npx test  # This is forbidden
```

## Credentials

You will find credentials for various users in `local_testme` file. Use them when necessary

### Whitespace Checking Workflow
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Check for trailing whitespace before committing
# Check Python files
grep -r '[ \t]+$' --include="*.py" .

# Check JavaScript/JSX files
grep -r '[ \t]+$' --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" .

# Check all text files
grep -r '[ \t]+$' --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.md" --include="*.txt" .

# ❌ WRONG - Don't commit files with trailing whitespace
# Always clean whitespace before committing
```

### Automated Linting Setup

- **ALWAYS fix whitespace issues before running tests**

### Editor Configuration Requirements
- **ALWAYS configure editors to trim trailing whitespace on save**
- **ALWAYS configure editors to show whitespace characters**
- **ALWAYS use consistent line ending settings**
- **ALWAYS enable automatic formatting on save**

### Pre-commit Validation
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Validate code quality before committing
# Run whitespace check
./utils/check_whitespace.sh

# Run linting
./utils/lint_code.sh

# Run tests
./utils/run_tests.sh

# ❌ WRONG - Don't commit without validation
# Always run checks before committing
```

## Frontend Code Quality and ESLint Validation

### Frontend File Change Requirements
- **ALWAYS check frontend container logs for ESLint errors after making changes to frontend files**
- **ALWAYS run ESLint validation within the frontend container**
- **NEVER commit frontend changes without ESLint validation**
- **ALWAYS fix ESLint errors before considering changes complete**

### Frontend ESLint Validation Workflow
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Check frontend container logs for ESLint errors
# After making changes to frontend files, check container logs:
docker-compose logs divemap_frontend | grep -i "eslint\|error\|warning"

# Or run ESLint directly in the frontend container:
docker-compose exec divemap_frontend npm run lint

# Check for specific file errors:
docker-compose exec divemap_frontend npm run lint -- --fix

# ❌ WRONG - Don't ignore ESLint errors in frontend container
# Always validate frontend code quality before proceeding
```

### Frontend Code Quality Standards
- **ALWAYS ensure all JavaScript/JSX files pass ESLint validation**
- **ALWAYS fix import order issues (import/order)**
- **ALWAYS fix React hooks rules violations (react-hooks/rules-of-hooks)**
- **ALWAYS fix Prettier formatting issues (prettier/prettier)**
- **ALWAYS remove trailing whitespace (no-trailing-spaces)**
- **ALWAYS fix unused variables and imports (no-unused-vars)**
- **ALWAYS validate prop types where applicable (react/prop-types)**

### Frontend Error Categories to Address
- **Critical**: ESLint errors that prevent compilation
- **High Priority**: React hooks rules violations
- **Medium Priority**: Import order and formatting issues
- **Low Priority**: Unused variables and prop type warnings

### Frontend Validation Checklist
Before considering frontend changes complete:
- [ ] ESLint validation passes in frontend container
- [ ] No critical ESLint errors in container logs
- [ ] Import order follows project standards
- [ ] React hooks follow rules of hooks
- [ ] Prettier formatting is consistent
- [ ] No trailing whitespace in files
